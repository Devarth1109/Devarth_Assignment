Q: How memory is managed in Python?
A: Python has different memory management rather than other traditional languages.
- memory manages in block system.
- The Python memory manager has different components which deal with various dynamic storage management aspects, like sharing, segmentation, preallocation or caching.
-Memory management in Python involves a private block containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private block is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.
Ex : a = "hello"
     print(id(a))
Out : 2216689726960

Q: What is the purpose continue statement in python?
A: The continue keyword is used to end the current iteration in a for loop (or a while loop), and continues to the next iteration.
- Example for While loop : i = 0
                           while i <= 10:
                                i += 1
                                if i == 4:
                                    continue
                                print(i)
- Out : 1
        2
        3
        5
        6
        7
        8
        9
        10
        
- Example for For loop : x = ("apple","banana","chickoo","guava","graps")
                         for y in x:
                             if y == "chickoo":
                                 continue
                             print(y)
                             
- Out : apple
        banana
        guava
        graps
        
 Q: What is negative indexing, Why it is used?
 A: Negative Indexing is used to in Python to begin slicing from the end of the string i.e. the last. Slicing in Python gets a sub-string from a string. The slicing range is set as parameters i.e. start, stop and step.
